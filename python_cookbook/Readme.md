###Python Cookbook###

This is a series of jupyter (or ipython) notebooks containing various tips and tricks in Python that could be useful in everyday scripting.

The idea is inspired by the book _Python Cookbook (3rd edition), David Beazely & Brian Jones_. The examples are taken directly from the book in most cases. Later on, I will also add additional tips learnt during my experience with Python.
