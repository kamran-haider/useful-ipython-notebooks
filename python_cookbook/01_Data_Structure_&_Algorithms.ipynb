    "Note that we used `_` as a throw-away variable. While this form of unpacking might seem trivial but the first thing to notice here is that our code looks quite compact and neat. On the contrary, we could have used three separate lines such that `x = data[1]`, `y = data[2]` etc, which obviously works but isn't as neat. Furthermore, we are only beginning to see the value of this unpacking capability. Check out the next example:"
